## Overview

### Problem

Many small and medium-sized businesses manage employee attendance, overtime, leave, and payroll separately, often relying on manual calculations that can lead to salary errors. Employees may only discover unexpected salary deductions on payday, causing confusion, complaints, and a lack of transparency. HR teams also spend significant time calculating salaries and handling payroll-related issues.

### Solution

e-Salary Guard is an AI-powered payroll management system that automatically calculates employees’ net salaries based on attendance, overtime, bonuses, and leave records. Its AI feature classifies leave requests based on the reasons provided, helping HR review requests more efficiently. The system also provides early WhatsApp-style notifications about salary deductions, transparent salary breakdowns, and activity logs to improve accountability and reduce payroll disputes.

### Key Features

- AI-Powered Leave Classification — Classifies leave requests as tolerated or subject to salary deductions, with confidence scores and HR review.

- Automated Payroll & Salary Insights — Calculates net salaries automatically and provides HR with insights into salary costs, overtime, bonuses, and deductions.

- Early Deduction Notifications — Sends simulated WhatsApp notifications to inform employees about salary deductions, their reasons, and estimated net salaries before payday.

- Transparent Activity Logs — Records salary changes, HR decisions, recalculations, and payroll payments to improve accountability.

- One-Click Payroll Processing — Allows HR to review salary breakdowns and process payroll through a controlled confirmation workflow.

### Tech Stack

| Layer         | Technology                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Frontend      | e.g. HTML, React             |
| Backend       | e.g. Python, Flask / FastAPI |
| Database      | e.g. PostgreSQL, SQLite      |
| AI / Compute  | RunPod (GPU)                 |
| Hosting / Dev | Replit                       |

## How to Run

### Option 1 — Run on Replit (Recommended)

1. Open the [Replit Project](https://replit.com/@your-username/your-project), or import this repository via **Create Repl → Import from GitHub**.
2. Open the **Secrets** tab (🔒) and add the variables listed in `.env.example`:
   - `RUNPOD_API_KEY`
   - `RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID`
3. Click **Run**. Replit uses the `.replit` file to start `python src/main.py`.

### Option 2 — Run Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env            # then fill in your values

# 5. Run the app
python src/main.py
```

### Run Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## How We Use Replit *(Required)*

Describe how your team used Replit. For example:

- **Development:** Collaborative coding in a shared Repl using Multiplayer.
- **Hosting:** The app is deployed with Replit Deployments at the Live Demo link above.
- **Secrets:** API keys are stored in Replit Secrets, never in the code.

📄 Proof of use: [`submission/SDC2026_TeamName_Replit_POU.pdf`](submission/SDC2026_TeamName_Replit_POU.pdf)

## How We Use RunPod *(Required)*

Describe how your team used RunPod. For example:

- **Workload:** Model inference (e.g. text generation, image processing) runs on a RunPod GPU.
- **Setup:** `runpod/handler.py` is deployed as a **RunPod Serverless Endpoint**.
- **Integration:** The Replit app sends requests to the endpoint using `RUNPOD_API_KEY` and `RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID`.

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.runpod.ai/v2/$RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID/runsync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RUNPOD_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": {"prompt": "Hello"}}'
```
